# CollegeCMS - College Cluster Management System

The idea was originally proposed by our mentor, who envisioned a Cluster Management System to simplify academic coordination for students and faculty. In the 4th year, managing student information, teacher details, and multiple records had become challenging, as everything was scattered across PDFs, schedules, and numerous emails. This system was designed to bring all that data together in one centralized platform, making it easier to access, organize, and track academic information efficiently.
